The idea for this project is to make the code for this web page both easier to read as well as making the site more user friendly.

The first item to be fixed was the header which was used as a class under the tag div. I changed it to a header tag.

Also, in the place of div under header I changed the tag to nav as the links navigate to other locations in the site.

Removed was also the li and lu as they did not seem necisary. I had to play with margins but everything seems to work and line up as it did before.

Also in style.css, I consolitated alot of the header tags to cut down on clutter.

alt were added to images as well as cleaning up the tags as images are self contained tags.

Many items in style.css were not grouped properly so that was fixed.

The search engine optimization link was fixed.
